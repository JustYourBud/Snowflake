# Snowflake
### Concocted by Louie Chudziak

This is a Discord bot written in JavaScript using the discord.js library. Initially, it was created to get the lowest possible 19 digit snowflake ID on Discord when the IDs transitioned from 18 digits to 19 digits. (If you're wondering, the lowest we got was 1000000000190853221, only 19 off as the last 7 digits have effectively no chance of being all 0s)

Since then the bot was repurposed to log the ID of every message sent in my server for everybody to see. Why? I dunno it was unfunny then and unfunny now but that's what makes it great.

Any additions made to this bot will probably be written with half-assed code and for extremely specific purposes in my private server so you probably have no need for it and this doesn't really have any reason to be open source--I just like making extremely stupid tinkering projects like this public in the improbable event that someone finds it because that's just a really funny thought to me. But in case you somehow did find this thing and you decide that some of the code used here is somehow not only clean but useful, then by all means feel free to use it. (Seriously though no effort is going into this codebase and updates will be extremely infrequent so why are you even here?)
